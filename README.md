* Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
This project was made to take in and proccess data in the from of a txt file conatining the produce purchased during a day.
The data is ran parsed and added to a map, that stores the item name and number of times the item appears in the file, counting the number of times the item is purchased.
The data is then added to a dat file with the item name and the count of how many times the item is purchased, the program also allows the user to search for individual items and see the counts,
or to display each item and count in the main loop of the program.

* What did you do particularly well?
  During the creation of this project, I did a great job handling the data from the files, and using a map to store the data and make it easy to count the data accordingly. I also did a good job handling the file input,
  if the file inputed does not exist, the program will reloop so the program wont crash, or create an empty file.

* Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
